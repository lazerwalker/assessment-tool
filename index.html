      <h1 class='mb-3'>Facilitators</h1>
      <div class='mb-4'>Wellness program facilitators are employee or organizational characteristics that support the success of wellness programs. </div>
      <div class='mb-4'>Read each statement and place a check next to those statements that describe your organization currently, or which could describe your organization.  For example, even if leadership does not currently positively communicate about wellness, you would place a check next to “Leadership communicates positive messages about wellness” if you think Leadership has the capacity to do so in the near future.</div>

        <h1 class='mb-3'>Critical Barriers (i.e., “Deal Breakers”)</h1>
        <div class='mb-4'>Here, we list what we consider to be “critical” barriers, which, when present, strongly indicate that a program will not be successful if implemented.</div>
        <div class='mb-4'>Read each statement and place a check next to those statements that describe your organization.</div>

        <h1 class='mb-3'>Non-Critical Barriers</h1>

        <div class='mb-4'>There are additional barriers that could hinder the success of wellness programs in your organization; however, these are not necessarily “deal breakers” - meaning that, even if these barriers exist within your organization, you can still have a functional wellness program.</div>
        <div class='mb-4'>As with the previous two checklists, read each statement and place a check next to those statements that describe your organization currently.</div>

    <div id='results' class='section mt-4'>
      <h1 class='mb-3'>Building a Successful Wellness Program</h1>
      <div class='mb-4'>In the previous sections, you identified the type or types of wellness programs that “Best Fit” your organization’s opportunities (Facilitators) and constraints (Barriers). The type or types of programs that do not have “critical barriers” identified are considered a “fit.”  Types of programs where you have determined that critical barriers exist for those programs would NOT be considered a “fit.”</div>
      <div class='mb-4'>In the assessment, highlight any statements that you thought could - but do not currently - describe your organization that you need to work on in the near future to facilitate the success of the wellness program.  How can you change your organization (employees or the leadership) so that you have the most positive organizational conditions to launch the wellness program successfully?</div>
