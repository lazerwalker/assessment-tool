          <p>Hello and welcome to the interactive organizational assessment created by the <a href="http://www.healthyworkplaces.berkeley.edu/">Interdisciplinary Center for Healthy Workplaces</a> as part of the Finding Fit Employer Guide. This assessment will help you decide which wellness program you should introduce to your organization by identifying your organization’s current resources (Facilitators) and constraints (Barriers). </p>

          <p>This assessment is intended for leadership but can be used by any employee.</p>

          <p>This assessment will take approximately <strong>15-20</strong> minutes.</p>

          <h3>Dashboard</h3>

          <p>The assessment will look at eight wellness program types, each with varying amounts of organizational leadership involvement.</p>

          <p>As you answer the following assessment questions, the interactive model will change depending on your answers. The blue bar represents the level of “fit” the program has with your organization and the red bar represents the level of difficulty to implement the program.</p>

          <p>The program types are as follows:</p>

          <p><strong>Education Programs (E):</strong> The organization leadership recommends or provides educational resources that employees may utilize on their own outside of work. Examples are classes, lecture, podcast, video, and clubs where employees can learn about heathy behaviors and pursue them on their own.</p>

          <p><strong>Social Community Building by the Employee (SCB-E):</strong> Employees are given the onus to initiate in a grassroots manner a variety of social activities for the purpose of enhancing social relationships at work and experiencing more enjoyment in life with their peers. Organizational leadership encourages employees to make their own events.  Example are employees scheduling happy hours or initiating fitness challenges with their co-workers. </p>

          <p><strong>Social Community Building by the Organization (SCB-E):</strong> An organizational leadership takes initiative to arrange social events and the creation of interest groups. Examples are leaders sponsoring a sports team, women's groups, healthy eaters club, etc. Leaders can also support groups and social events by supporting them financially. </p>

          <p><strong>Preventative Care Program Lite (PCP-L):</strong> The organization leadership involves their health insurance vendor or other third party to perform health assessments and preventative screenings. Employee-specific recommendations are then delivered to the employee in order to encourage illness- and disease-prevention.</p>

          <p><strong>Healthy Habit Development Lite (HHD-L):</strong> The organization leadership initiates a set of interventions in the workplace that encourage healthier eating, greater physical activity, tracking personal mental and physical health, and  restoration. Examples of interventions include providing healthier food at work, organization-sponsored classes on-site, gym memberships, health tracking through wearable devices, and local health-related events such as “fun runs.”</p>

          <p><strong>Healthy Habit Development Enhanced (HHD-E):</strong> The organization leadership makes a much greater investment in making physical enhancements to the worksite to introduce healthier habits as a part of an employee’s workday. Examples include building an in-house gym, in-house cafeterias, meditation room, quiet room, sleeping areas, nursing room, and gardens. In addition, the organization may also provide other workspace enhancements such as natural light, temperature controls, noise pollution controls, and good ventilation systems.</p>

          <p><strong>Preventative Care Program Enhanced (PCP-E):</strong> The organization leadership develops a partnership between healthcare providers in an effort to reduce the incidence of serious illness and disease. The purpose is to integrate health promotion into the organization’s culture and organizational decision making. Examples are having morning yoga or meditation classes led by professionals, providing access to therapists, and providing assess to targeted programs such as smoking cessation and weight lost management. </p>

          <p><strong>Disease Management (D):</strong> The organization leadership makes significant investments in the establishment of in-house medical clinics and occupational health programs in order to service employees who are already sick, injured, or have active diseases that need consistent treatment. The role of the leadership is to ensure effective operation of the clinic and its programming to meet employee’s health needs. </p>

          <div class='mb-4'>Now that you have identified your organization’s wellness program facilitators, the following questions will aim to find out about your organization’s wellness program barriers. Wellness program barriers are employee or organizational characteristics that prevent or undermine the success of wellness programs.</div>

        <div class='mb-4'>By completing the previous sections, you identified the type or types of wellness programs that best fit your organization’s opportunities (Facilitators) and constraints (Barriers). The type or types of programs that do not have “critical barriers” identified are considered a “fit.”  Types of programs where you have determined that critical barriers exist for those programs would NOT be considered a “fit.” You can see your results on a sidebar and on this page.</div>
